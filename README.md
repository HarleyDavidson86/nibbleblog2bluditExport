# nibbleblog2bluditExport
This exporter tranforms all your Nibbleblog posts, pages and images to Bludit format.

Preparations:

For better handling I suggest to download the complete Nibbleblog page and run on a 
local webserver (but it works also online, of course).
Download the complete zip-File and create a new directory called "bluditExport" at
[nibbleblog-root-directory]\themes\
and copy all files of the exporter in this new directory. Then activate the theme 
in your Nibbleblod-Administration-Panel.
After this visit your Blog for further instructions.
